# ncurses_snake_c
Snake in the terminal with ncurses. Written for Linux.

I threw this together before the fall semester as a warm up before I started taking intermediate data structures and algorithms at
Virginia Tech. I spent the previous month self-studying discrete math, so I hadn't programmed in a while. This was a
good way to prepare for the upcoming semester.

I'm currently rewriting this in c++ to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of that language and make it more extensible. Planning to use OO principles to make it easier to give individual parts of the snake different looks.

To run, compile with libncurses.
